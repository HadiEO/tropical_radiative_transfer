# Radiative transfer modelling of forest reflectance using PROSPECT and PARAS

This is the full code repository used for analysis in the paper "Hadi, M. Pfeifer, L. Korhonen, C. Wheeler, M. Rautiainen. 2017. Forest canopy structure and reflectance in humid tropical Borneo: A physically-based interpretation using spectral invariants. Remote Sensing of Environment 201, 314-330" (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717304303). The codes are in the process of being cleaned, re-structured, and better documented. Field data used are not mine.
